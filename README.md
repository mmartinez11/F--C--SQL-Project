# Description
This project is a Windows Forms Application. It showcases two different methods of retrieving data.
One method is the use of an F# library. This library is used to read and retrieve data from a CSV file.
The second method is creating a SQL connection where we can use C# code to call different queries to receive
different data from the database.
